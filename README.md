# The-Mystery-of-Questown
My actual text-based adventure game. I realized the intended scope was more than I can accomplish by the deadline for the project, so I'm putting it on the back-burner for now.<br>
If you're curious about *that* game, [here's](https://github.com/DeroPlayz/The-Mystery-of-Questown) the link.

# Summary
You are a 2X year old who just moved to Questown, a rural town in an unnamed country, to get away from the stress of big city living.

But, you notice some stuff is… off. People disappear, things you've never heard of sound familiar, and sketchy folk keep showing up at random. You decide to look into this, but the rabbit hole is deeper than you expected.

Do you have the brains to figure out the Mystery of Questown?
